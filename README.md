## 📄 Abstract
This repository contains the technical whitepaper investigating the severe latency and compatibility issues observed when interfacing a standard **Male Logic Unit (MLU)** with the advanced **Female Operating System (FOS)**.

## 🛠 Installation & Usage
Attempting to install logic drivers into the FOS environment usually results in a kernel panic.

```bash
$ npm install common-sense
> Error: Package 'common-sense' is incompatible with 'current_mood'
> Rolling back to previous version: 'silent_treatment_v2.0'

## 🐛 Known Issues (Bugs)

### 1. The "I'm Fine" Packet Loss
* **Severity:** Critical
* **Description:** When the User sends the string "I'm fine," the system registers it as a simple status update. However, the actual payload contains 4GB of encrypted emotional data that the MLU fails to decrypt.
* **Workaround:** Do not attempt to parse. Initiate `apology_sequence.exe` immediately.

### 2. The "Restaurant" Infinite Loop
* **Severity:** High
* **Description:** The function `select_dinner_location()` enters a circular dependency where `User_A` waits for `User_B`, who waits for `User_C`, who rejects all proposals.
* **Current Fix:** Hard reset required (Male Override).

### 3. Memory Leak (The "2019" Archive)
* **Severity:** Moderate
* **Description:** The system retains high-fidelity logs of every minor argument since 2019. These logs occupy 90% of available RAM during new disputes, causing significant performance degradation.
